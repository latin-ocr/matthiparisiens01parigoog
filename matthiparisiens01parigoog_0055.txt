halfa century later, a very partial and inaccurate colla·

tion of the text was given by Wats¹ in his repriut of
Parker's edition of the “ Historia Major,'' 1640 ; and a
transcript of the entire work was made by Twysden in
1648, with a view probably to publication.²

Subsequently, however, to this period it appears 'to
have been overlooked and forgotten, or, ifnoticed at all,
only in the inaccurate references by later bibliographers.
The first in recent times who called attention to the
importanoe of this work, was the Rev. J oseph Stevenson
in the notes and illustratione to his valuable edition of
Sir Rohert Gray’s Scclccronico‚ 1836, p. 211, and he re·
marks that it varied so much from the Greater Chronicle
printed by Wats‚ “as to assume the appearance of a
distinct version, and a version, too, which in many points
is fuller, strangu, and better than that already given to
the public.’' The same opinion is expressed also by the
Rev. H. Ο. Ooxe in the supplemental volume to his
edition of Wendover, 1844, who adds, “ It does seem
extraordinary that the work itself should never have ‘
been printed, being, as it is, so entirely throughout the
original work of Matthew Paris ;’' and to afford some
idea of the mode adopted in the composition of this =
“ highly interesting Chroniclc‚” he prints the text of the
years 1067-10721nclusive. .
