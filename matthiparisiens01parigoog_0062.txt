in other pages; but in 1258 (fol. 210, col. 2) it takes up
the text entirely (ed. Wats, p. 970, 139), and continues
it to the end. It concludes with a notice of the death ,
of Walter de Scotinni (ed. Wats, p. 988, l. 14), atter
which is added the remarkable note already noticed
(p. xxiii. 0.), and the drawing of Matthew Paris on his
death-bed. lt represents him raised upon his couch,
with his eyes closed, and his head supported by his
left arm, which rests on an open volume placed on
a reading-desk, on which is written “Liber Granico·

Rishanger, monk of St. Alban's, extending from 1259 .

vellum, in double columns, in an ordinary hand of the
latter part of the fonrteenth century. The lower margins
of the leaves bave suffered from damp, and the injury
has extended to several of the preceding leaves. At
the conclusion is the autograph note of the duke of
Gloucester (now erased), previously mentioned. The
scribe has performed his task in a careless manner, as
is evident on comparing the text with other copies in

MSS. Cott. Faust. B. lx„ and Claud. E. III. It was

printed from this MS. by archbishop Purher, and re·
