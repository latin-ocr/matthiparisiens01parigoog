Cambridge. the thirteenth century, and consisting 01 113 leaves,
The first six leaves at the beginning and two at the end
are not numbered, but the rest are paged by a hand 01
the fifteenth century from 1 10 281. The quires are also
numbered in Roman numerals from Ι. 10 XII, 00 far as
page 248. It contains the first part or volume of the
Greater Chronicle of Matthew Paris, the Chronica Mo·
jora Sancti Albani, from the Oreation to the end 01 the
year 1188. The text 01 Wendover has been transcribed
under the eye 01 Paris, and corrected by himself, with
autograph additions, either on leaves inserted, or written
in the margins. These inserted leaves occur at pp. 15-
20, 31-2, 37-8, 253-256. The remainder of the volume
is written by two hands, the first of which is that of‘the
associate 01 Paris, whose aid has been given 1ο him in
his other manuscripts (see p. li), and is easily to be
recognized by its regular, black, upright character. This
hand begins the work, aud extends through pp. 1-14,
21-30, 33-36, 39-117,193-252, 257-282, but the rubrica

and coloured initial letters are supplied by Paris through-
out a portion of the text, and the headings from p. 174

the first, but is rounder, and appears 1ο extend from
p. 117 10 192, but occasionally varies. The Chronicle
begins with the rubrio, Incipit Proloyaa io librant qai
Floras Historiarum intitulatur, over which archbishop
Parker has written, “ Author Matthaeus.’' The text
previous to the Conquest is known only by the printed
etsocctmeato 01 it, ascribed to “ Matthew 01 Westminster.’'
The marginal additions 01 Matthew Paris (both in his
round and secretary hands) are at first few in number,
but gradually become more numerous after the year 1100.
The text is illustrated also by shields 01 arms 01 the

sovereigns from William 1, and by drawings from the
