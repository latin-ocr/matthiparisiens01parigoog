well-marked character, which becomes looser and not so
firm at the close. Itis in double columns, with initial
letters of red and blus, which are larger and more orna·
mented at the commencement of a reign. There are
also headings in red over each page. A good specimen
of the manuscript is afforded by the faesimile prefixed
to the present volume. The text has been revised and
corrected by the author more than once, and there are
numerous erasures, substitutione, and additions, all of
which have been carefully noted in tho present edition.¹
Some of these alterations are written in blue ink, which
serves to mark a revision at a particular period,² and
at other times corrections are made in the lower margin
with a plummet‚ and afterwards introduced into the
text In many instances passages os the text have been
partially or wholly erased, and re·written on slips of
vellum fastened down over the original readings. This
ia especially the case in the years 1244-1251. These
slips have been carefully raised, and the text beneath
deciphered and noted, whenever it was possible to be
done. Coloured shields of arms of the English and
foreign sovereigns are drawn in the margine, aa also of
many of the barons and distinguished personages, all
oi which have been engraved and inserted in their
places in the present edition. illustrative drawings are
occasionally added by the author (who was of equal
repnte both as an artist and historiam), and these have
been described in my notes.

in the 13th, leth, and 15th centurieS, but at a later date
