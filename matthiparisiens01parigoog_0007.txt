should be selected for publication under competent editors
without reference to periodica] 01 chronological arrange-
ment, without mutilation or abridgment, preference being
giren, in the first instance, to such materiale as were most
scarae and valuablc.

He proposed that each chronicle 01 historical document
10 bc edited should be treated in the same way as 11 the
edItor were engaged 011 an Editio Princeps ; and for this
purpose the most correct text should be formed from an
accurate collation of thc best MSS.

ro render the work more generally useful, the Master
01 the Bolis suggested that tho editor should give an
account 01 the MSS. employed by him, 01 their age and
their peculiarities3 that hc should add to the work abrief
account of the life and times 01 the author, and any
remarks necessary to explain the cluonology ; but no other
