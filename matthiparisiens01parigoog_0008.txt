'Ihe works to be published in octavo, separately, as
they were finished3 the whole responsibih'ty of the task
resting upon the editors, who were to be chosen by the
Master of the Rolls with the sanction of the Treasury.

The Irords¹ of Her Majesty’s Treasury, after a earesul
consideration of the subject, expressed their opinion in a
Treasmy Minute, dated February 9‚1857‚ that the plan
recommended by the Master of the Rolls “was well
calculated for the accompl’nhment of this important
national object, in an effectual and satisfactory manner,
within a reasonable time, and provided proper attention be
paid to economy, in making the detailed arrangements,
without unneoessary expense.''

They expressed their approbation of the proposal that
each chronicle and historieal document should be edited
in such amanner as to represent with all possible correct-
ness the text of each writer, derived from a collation ottho
best MSS, and that no notes should be added, except
such as were illustrative of the various readings. They
suggested, however, that the presaoe to each work should
contain, in addition to the particulars proposed by the
Master of the Rolls, a biographical account of the author,
so far as authentic materials existed for that purpose,
andan estimate of his historical credibility and velue,
