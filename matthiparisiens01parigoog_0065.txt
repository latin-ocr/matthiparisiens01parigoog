pen oi the author, some of which exhibit much artistic
tulent At the close os the year 1188, on the lower
margin, is the following note by a hand of the fourteenth
century :¹ “Anno dominice incarnacionis Mcrxxxlx. est
vera continuacio historie Mathei Parisiensis in ulio volu-
mine, ejusdem manus,’' which undoubtedly refers to the
second volume of the work in MS. (l. Ο. 0. O, No. xvi

The leaves at the beginning and end of this volume
are filled with miscellaneous subjecte, written or drawn
by Matthew Paris, which may be regarded as prefatory
or supplementary to the Chroniele, viz. :-

c. The Itinerary from London to Jerusalem, in colours,
with a description in French, similar to the one in MS.
Reg. 14 C. vii, but containing some interesting variatione. ,
It occupies seven pages. The portion from London to
Dover is engraved by Gough, Bas Topogr, pl. vii,
fig. 2. . . . . . . [ff. l-lo]

b. A brief Genealogical Chroniclc, intitled, '“ &caica
crab conpendio ub[b]rcoiota a fratrc M. Parthienstss' the
introduction to which commences, “ Considerans prolixi·
tatem Cronicorum Angliae.’' ...... [fol la]

This is the prefaee mentioned by arehbishop Parker so '
erroneously⁹ as the Prologuc to the “Historia Minor.''

The Genealogy begins with Alfred (whose bustis drawn
in the centre of two circles, the outer of which is divided
into the kingdoms of the Heptarchy)‚ but terminates

abruptly at the bottom of tbe page, with the children of
Edward the Elder. It is resumed, however, at the end
