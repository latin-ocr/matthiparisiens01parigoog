twm.''¹ The text (except in the prefate) agrees through-
out very closely with the Douce copy, so that itis rareto
find even the slightest variation. At the conclusion is the
same notice of the author, “ Hucusque‚’' etc There ean
beno doubt that this is the manuscript which formerly
belonged to Sir Christopher Heydon, of Bsconsthorp, in
N orfolk (a scholar of considerable eminenos, who died in
1623),⁹ as proved by a note of that MS. prefixed to a
copy of “ Matthew of Westminster'’ in the Bodleian
Library‚ MS. Laud 672, and referred to by Tannsr ln

on further consideration it was thought unneoessary and,

in some respecta, inexpedient.
