XXX PREFACE.

subsequently to the receipt of thia letter from Flaeius,
the archbishop appears to have been more euocesafirl in
hie inquiries sor copies of the works of Matthew Paria,

aided‚ no doubt, by the printed order of Privy (loun-
111, July 1568, which empowered him or hie depu-
tiea to borrow all the “ancient recorda and monumenta

belonging to the late dissolved monasteries,'’ that were
in the hande os privato persona.l He had thus obtained
from Edward Aglionby, of Balsall Temple, co. Warwiclu
anuire, the first volume of the larger work (founded on
Wendoveffs, and intitled also Flacca Hiatma'ccum), from
the Oreation to the end of 11883 ² while the second volume
of the same, from 1189 to 1253 inclusive (the greater
part of which waa in the autograph of the author), had
been fortunately acquired from Sir Henry Sidney, KG,
Lord Deputy of Ireland⁸ In addition to thia great
treaeure (the value of which Parker was quite unable tc
appreciata properly), he had horrowed a MS! from Sir
William Oecil, Secretary of State, commencing in 1066
and ending in 1208,ὅ compiled in the fiiteenth century,
and containing a 11111111 teat, that is to say, partly taken
from the Greater Chronicle, and partly from the shorter
Hietcry. The earl of Arundel had also lent the arch-
biehop a valuable volume containing the Hiatoric Aa·
