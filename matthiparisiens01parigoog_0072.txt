copied from the 6116 in essecestram. It has
been engreved in the Atlas of the Viconte de Santarem,
pt i 1849, and described in tom. ii. pp. 257-272 of his
Easoc' 6111 1Ή1616116111 lo Goeowyrophia The heading
. attho commencement of the Chronicle is the sameas in
Ο. 0. 0.(1. xxvi, from which, doubtless‚ it was transcribed,
and the marginal additions of Matthew Paris in the
original are here inserted in the text.

The second part extends from 1189 to 1250, and
hus been folio’d hya contemporary hand, from foll
to fol 232 (now 392). The text is in double columns,
written in 6 thin, close character, with large red and
blue initials of the norrow form peculiar' 16 the period
at which it was copied. It was certainly transcribed from
MS. O. O. C. 0. N o. xvi, and probably soon after the work
had been completed and corrected to the year 1250, and
therefore under the eye of Matthew Paris himself If
any further proof of this were required, it is fumished
by the notes in his handwriting on the margins of
ff. 214 b, 216 6, 226, and elsewhere, as also by his draw-
ings in the years 1216 1111111217, at ff. 208, 213, and
2146111661 16 those in the Cambridge MS. Here, as
in the first part, the corrections and marginal additions of
the original are incorporated into the text. Occasionally,
but very rarely, there are insertione in this copy not in
the Cambridge MS, as may be seen in Wats's collatione
under the years 1216 (66. p. 290), and 1242 (ed p. 584).
The text concludes on fol. 293 with the words “ Quod
postea proferat setas,” after which a much later hand
has added, “ Quoedom Geato de 1696 Α11111116,” taken out
of Geoffrey of Moumouth The portion of the Chronicle
assigned to Wendover (near the close of 1235) ends 611
fol 257 with the words “dignissima judicatur,’' and in
the margin is noted, “Hucusque in a0. li0. [alio libro].''¹
