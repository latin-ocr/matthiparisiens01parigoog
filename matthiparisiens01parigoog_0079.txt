France,” tom. xvii, print a few pagos from this manu·

G. In O. C. C, Cambr, N o. lvi—A thick folio volume,
written by various hands of the sixteenth century for
archbishop Parker, in or about 1567. 11 10 described

anno 1273.” It contains a transcript of the Arundel
manuscript, including the Historia saporam, from
1067101253 ; the 101100οο011οο ofthe Greater Chronicle,
from 1254 to 12593 and the Continuation, from 1259 10
1273. The Prologue, “ De chronographia,” has been col-
lated 10 the present edition, in order to show the extreme
licence taken by the copyist in altering the original text.
In the initial letter D are introduced the arms of Perker,
and to carry out a silly conceit of making the first eight
lines commeuce with the vowel 0, several words have been
altered, and so printed t At the beginning of the reign
of Henry III, Parker's arms are again inserted, with the
date 1567, and attho end of 1253 is the following note:
“Hucusque progreditur Historia Min0r; quae sequuntur
eunt cx Historia Majore Mattbaei Parisiensis.” At the
beginning 0100 of 1254 is written, “Ex libro Arund.
com.” The portion from this year to 1273 has been
used for the press, as appears by Parker’s references to
his edition in the margins. Througbout the transcript
there have been marginal notes, now covered over with

00000, and one of them, in 1167, 00060, “Omnes hae literae
inseruntur in exemplari diri Cecilii,'' which proves that
at that date Sir Will Occil's manuscript was in tho arch·
