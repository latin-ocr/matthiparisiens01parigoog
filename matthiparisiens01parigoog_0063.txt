printed by Wats3 but a more correct and critical edition
has lately been published under the editorship of Mr. H.
T. Riley.

On the whole, it would appear certain that, with the
exception of the two leaves inserted by Parker, the
volume remeius at present exactly in the same state in
which it was left at the beginning of the fifteenth
century.

In preparing the Historia Aaylorrom for prese, the Textofthe
manuscript has been scrupulously followed, except ingd'ffl
cases of obvious error or omissi0n; but no correction
whatever hes been made unaccompanied by a note to
point it out. Notwithstanding the repeated revision of
the text by the author himself, many imperfect, obscure,
or erroneous passages were found, in which aid from
other sources was required ; and as the present work is
based throughout on the G1·eater0hr0nicle,and the letter
(down to the year 1235) on Wendover, it became almost
alebour of necessity to recur in all doubtful cases to the
existing manuscripts of these works3 and this was the
more necessary from the fact, that in re-writing his
Chronicle in an abridged form, Matthew Paris certainly
had before him the copy of the greater work now for-
tunately preserved in Corpus Christi College, Cambridge.l
Not only this copy, but others, have been consulted with MSS. oon·
advantage, and their readings referred to in the notesby {mig-
letters, which indicate the several manuscripts, of which
a description is ltere annexed.²
