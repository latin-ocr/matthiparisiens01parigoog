0 Η MS. Cotton Vitellius D. IL-An abridged transcript
of the Arundel manuscript, made in 1565 by William
Lambarde, assisted by Laurenca N owell and some other
person, whose hand has not been identified. In some
notes originally prefixed (preserved by Wats, Proefi 011
Vcr. tect), but now missing, Lambarde intitles it
“Matthaei Paris Historia Minor,’' and again, “Historia
rerum ab octo primis post conquisitionem Angliae regi-
bus gestarum, Matthaeo Parisiensi authore,'' signed W.
Lambarde,1565; and adds, “ Advertendum est, quod hoc
exemplar non cst ad verbum transcriptum, sed ea quae
ad historiam Angliae pertinent summa fide et fere verba-
tim traducuntur. Oaetera (forinseca cum sint) ut pluri-
mum levi praeteriit pede scriptor, nonnunquam etiam
plane omisit.'’ The transcript, however, is by no means
literal or faithful, but great liberties have been taken
with it. A short specimen from the year 1118 is given
by Wats‚ and he collates it from 1255 10 1273, under the
title of Minor, not knowing that it was copied from the
Arundel MS. There is ample evidence of this, therefore
the assertion first made by sir Robert Cotton in his MS.
Catelogue (MS. Harl. 6018, f 51), and repeated by his
librarian J ames in the notice prefixed of the contente of
the volume, as also by Dr. Smith in his printed catalogue,
