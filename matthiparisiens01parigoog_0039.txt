Some years, however, previous to the publication ofGrerter

“ Matthew of Westminster,’' archbishop Parlrer had turned
his attention to a far more important work, the Greater
Chronicle of Matthew Paris, but had not at first suc-
oeeded in meeting with a copy of it. This we may infer
from a letter addressed to the arohbishop hy Mathias
Flacius (Francowitz)‚ surnamed Illyricus, in May 1561,
who writes from the University oi J ena, where he was
Professor, in the following terms: “Et quoniam etiam

proxime tua Amplitudo indicavit Matthaei Paris Chronica
⁴ apud ooe orote reperiri, mitto Excerpta ejus, quse dudum
per· quendam amicum fueram consecutus.”¹ These Ex-
cerpts had, no doubt, been communicated to Flacius by
Bale, and were published by the formarat Baelo in the
Cauoque Tettium Votdtotc'e in 1556, pp. 593-631, and
reprinted in 1562 and 1608. They were not, however,
taken (as Flacius supposed) from the larger work of
Matthew Paria, but are chiefly derived from his shorter
History, intitled by the author Historia Appianum,

printed for the first time in the present publication.2
