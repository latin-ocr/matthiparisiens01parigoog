lx 1111101

It 10 wretchedly engraved by Gough, Brit. Topopr,
vol. i.‚ pl. iii.. fig. 3, and described 01 p. 64, with many
011010. The names are strangely disfigured3 thus Burn-
husrc (Bamborough) is turned into Baba, and Stratherrrc
into scorta mandra!

On the seventh leaf commences the 011011010, 0111 01 ,

the top 01110 page 10 01 inscription in red letters, now
’ partly erased, by which Matthew Paris recorded his gift

' 01 1110 volume to the ehurch 01 St. Alban’e. The year

1189 begins “Anno Dominicae Nativitatis ........ ¹
octogesimo nono, rex Henricus.’' The text 01 ¹Wendover
isretained to the year 1235, 111 with large additions,
and is then continued to 1253, with numerous correc-
tions, erasures, and marginal additions, exhibiting the
work in its 0101001 progress, 00 1101 11 10 101 surprising
that the entire volume should have been attributed to
Matthew Paris by a later writer 01 St. Alban’s' 1101-

11010 01110 abruptly at the close of 1253 (1101001 1001
having been lost), and it 10 worthy of remark how
archbishop Parker has dealt with the imperfect text.
He has crossed out with his pen the whole of it after
the words “ princeps apostolorum constituitur '' (ed.
Wats, p. 880, l. 45), and on the lower margin tren-
0011100110 short annual summary from the 111111101Μὸ,
which he prints in the place of the portion struck out.
Yet Wats reprints this text without one word of com·
ment or note 01 any variatim, which does not say much
